# List-it-

# Objective - 
The objective of the project is to provide an automated monthly grocery list to the user.

# Description -
Although the applications objective sounds a lot like a simple grocery manager app or like any other "Inventory Management" app , the app is much much more than that . 
So what's different in List It! ?

The Key advantage of List It! which makes it standout from other applications is the way we input the data or commodities we bought . Where in all "Inventory Management" Applications , the user has to input the data by hand , by typing the data for each product manually , which lets be honest , is a tiering process which no one is going to do, List It! does things a tad differently , instead of typing , the user can use the camera on his/her smartphone , and scan the barcode present on the product which would automatically add the item to his/her grocery list.

# But what if I bought a fruit which does not have a barcode ?

List It ! has you covered ! The app can also detect any fruit which is placed in front of it through its intelligent AI ( Tensor Flow ). 
The application then detects your products and then add it to your own personalized database on Firebase. 

All the above mentioned tasks are currently functioning on the app and its nearly complete. I have alot of future ambitious plans based on the project.
